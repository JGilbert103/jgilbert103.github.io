                    <p>Now I keep saying "ourselves," "us," and "we", however, Tranquil3D is owned by me, Jake Gilbert. I am a junior at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte I study computer science with a concentration of Software, System, and Networks. However, I want to learn a lot about the many aspects of computing. >I have worked with cloud computing and used systems supporting the Hadoop framework and Apache Spark. I code in Java, C++, C#, Python, HTML, and CSS</p>

                    <p>I have developed my own game with the help of a friend to make the models. The game is titled <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2486520/Paint_Desk_Simulator/" target="_blank">Paint Desk Simulator.</a> Overall, I enjoy playing games, 3D modeling, hiking, kayaking, and hanging out with my family. Thank you for visiting and supporting Tranquil3D, my passion project.</p>
